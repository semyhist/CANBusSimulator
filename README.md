## About / Overview

Hey there! **CANBusSimulator** is your go-to tool for testing automotive systems without needing real CAN hardware. Written in efficient C, it faithfully recreates the CAN Bus protocol – arbitration, error handling, bit stuffing, and all. Imagine spinning up 8 virtual ECUs (Engine, ABS, Airbag, etc.) that talk over a simulated bus, complete with fuzzing attacks and anomaly detection.

This solves a huge pain point for **embedded devs, automotive engineers, and HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) testers**. No more waiting for physical buses or pricey tools – just compile, run, and test your algorithms locally. What sets it apart? A slick **React dashboard** for real-time visualization, candump-compatible logs, and security layers with 5 attack types. It's battle-tested for fuzzing and detection, making it ideal for research or production validation.

Whether you're prototyping ECUs, training ML models on CAN traffic, or hunting bus-off conditions, this sim has you covered. Created April 17, 2026 – fresh and ready to roll!

## Key Features

✨ **8 Simulated ECUs** — Engine, ABS, Airbag, Climate, Steering, Cabin, Tires, Dashboard with realistic message IDs and filters.

✨ **Full CAN Protocol Stack** — Arbitration, broadcast, bit stuffing, encode/decode via CANFrame struct.

✨ **Error Handling & States** — Error counters, NORMAL → ERROR-ACTIVE → BUS-OFF transitions per node.

✨ **Security Testing** — CANFuzzer with 5 attack types (fuzzing, replay, etc.) + CANDetector with 4 anomaly rules, logs to `logs/anomali.log`.

✨ **High-Perf Bus Layer** — 32-slot ring buffer for low-latency simulation.

✨ **React Dashboard** — Live visualization via `dashboard/public/can_dashboard.json`.

✨ **CAN Tools Suite** — Logger (candump format to `logs/can_traffic.log`), Parser (filter/stats), JSON exporter.

✨ **Turkish Support** — Bilingual docs for global automotive teams.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **GCC** or any C compiler (tested with GCC 12+)
- **Node.js 18+** (for React dashboard)
- **make** (for building)
- Linux/macOS recommended; Windows via WSL

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/semyhist/CANBusSimulator.git
   cd CANBusSimulator
   ```

2. Build the C simulator:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Start the React dashboard (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000

> 💡 **Tip:** Run `make clean` to rebuild from scratch.

---

## Usage

### Basic Simulation
Launch 8 ECUs on the virtual bus:

```bash
./can_simulator -n 8 -t 60  # Run 8 nodes for 60 seconds
```

Generates `logs/can_traffic.log` in candump format.

### Fuzzing & Detection
Test security layers:

```bash
./can_simulator -fuzz replay -d detect -o logs/anomali.log
```

> 📊 **View in Dashboard:** Dashboard auto-loads `can_dashboard.json` for live ECU stats, arbitration wins, and anomaly alerts.

### Parse Logs
```bash
./can_parser logs/can_traffic.log --filter=0x100 --stats
```
